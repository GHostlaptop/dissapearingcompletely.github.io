        <p>hi. <del>i'm doing fine right now</del></p>
    <p><b>read about my feelings</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Welcome --- <a href="">#001</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>faq</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li><h3>who are you?</h3></li>
    <p>as of now I would prefer it if i stayed anonymous, i might talk about certain things that make my identity
    more obvious, but other than that i don't think it's important who i am</p>
        <li><h3>why?</h3></li>
    <p>i need to vent out my feelings and frustrations, and for some reason i feel like someone could actually listen if i put it out on the internet (i know nobody will) </p>
        <li><h3>can i contact you?</h3></li>
    <p>thanks to icloud mail aliases, sure, you can. <a href="mailto:dissapearedcomplete@icloud.com">right here</a></p>
        <li><h3>would you like a hug?</h3></li>
    <p>i really really would, thank you very much</p>
